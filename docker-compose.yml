# base/docker-compose.yml
# Use this file to set up your containers.
#
# You need to select your backend and database(s):
#   Uncomment the stack block(s) that you want to use
#     Under 'links' choose the databases(s) you need and uncomment those lines
#       Don't forget to uncomment 'links:' as well
#   If you need databases, uncomment their respective blocks under 'services'
#     e.g. If you need db_postgres and db_redis, uncomment those two lines under 'links'.
#          Uncomment the "links:" line too. And uncomment the whole "db_postgres:" and
#          "db_redis:" blocks
